- How did you design your benchmarks?
We basically utilized a file with length 877130 (number of bytes) and just read
the entire thing. Obviously, with demand paging, a page fault would occur after 
every page, causing the program to page fault 200+ times and cause the program to
read from disk many more times than populating the entire space just once, and reading
through memory continuously. 

- What performance differences did you see?
Demand paging took ~0.30447s to complete, while populating
via mmap took 0.000970291s to complete.

- If you have time / interest, lets try to look at what exactly caused these
performance differences above. Our hardware has special performance counters
for measuring certain events such as number of cache misses, cycles per
instruction, etc. We can use these counters ourselves using the perf
commandline tool. `perf list` will print a list of all the counters your
hardware + OS support. Which counters did you find most interesting? What
results did you observe?
